**Playwright Java Test Automation POC (Gradle)**

This project is a proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating the use of Playwright with Java and TestNG for automated UI testing using Gradle as the build tool. The project includes examples of:
    * Extracting data from dynamic elements (such as tooltips and chart elements).
    * Using Playwright locators with methods like .nth(), .first(), and .last().
    * Handling SVG elements and dynamic content.
    * Integrating assertions (including string comparisons and boolean assertions) with TestNG.
    * Utility methods for tasks like reading data from Excel or working with HashMaps.

**Prerequisites**
    * Java JDK 8 or higher
    * Gradle (or use the provided Gradle wrapper)
    * Playwright for Java
    * Managed as a dependency in the build.gradle file.
    & TestNG - Used for writing and executing tests.
    * IDE (Eclipse)
    * For development and code formatting (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+F in Eclipse).
